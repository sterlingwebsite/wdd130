    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Laie, Hawaii is located on the windward side of Oʻahu. It features the Polynesian Cultural Center, Brigham Young
        University–Hawaii, the Laie Hawaii Temple, Laie Point, Laie Falls, and a number of nearby hikes and waterfalls.
        The area is surrounded by stunning landscapes, lush mountains, and the vast Pacific Ocean. The food is also
        wonderful, with local favorites like Seven Brothers and Kahuku Grill offering delicious island-style meals.</p>

    <p>I lived near Laie with my family for about two years, and it remains my favorite place. I hiked to waterfalls and
        mountaintops, traversed the jungle, swam, boated, dived, and spearfished in the ocean. I also worked at
        BYU–Hawaii in the nursery and visited the Laie temple many times. The experiences I had there shaped my love for
        nature, community, and adventure.</p>
