        <p>I live in Bluffdale, Utah. I married a Southern Californian woman last year, and in just one month from now,
            we're expecting our first child. For our honeymoon, we returned to California, where I got to see some of
            the places she grew up. She graduated from BYU–Idaho with a degree in Humanities about six years ago and has
            been teaching seminary ever since. I’ve completed my Associate’s degree at BYU–Idaho, and I’m now working
            toward a bachelor’s in software development so I can take over as the primary breadwinner for our family.
