                    <h3>Upper Colorado River</h3>
                    <p>Rafting on the Upper Colorado River offers a serene yet invigorating experience, ideal for
                        families, beginners, and nature lovers. Flowing through lush valleys and dramatic canyons near
                        Glenwood Springs and Vail, this stretch features mostly Class I–II rapids with occasional Class
                        III thrills during spring runoff. Rafters can expect gentle currents, crystal-clear water, and
                        breathtaking views of red rock cliffs, cottonwood groves, and wildlife like bald eagles and
                        bighorn sheep. It's a perfect introduction to white water rafting, blending adventure with
                        tranquility in the heart of the Rockies.</p>

                    <h3>Westwater Canyon</h3>
                    <p>Rafting in Westwater Canyon delivers a thrilling blend of technical rapids and remote wilderness,
                        making it one of the most sought-after whitewater experiences in the Southwest. Located near
                        Moab, Utah, this stretch of the Colorado River features Class III and IV rapids that surge
                        through narrow black granite gorges, creating dramatic drops and fast-moving chutes. Adventurers
                        navigate legendary rapids like Funnel Falls, Skull Rapid, and Sock-It-To-Me, all framed by
                        towering canyon walls and ancient rock formations. The trip offers both adrenaline and awe, with
                        opportunities to spot wildlife and absorb the canyon’s stark, spiritual beauty.</p>

                    <h3>Cataract Canyon</h3>
                    <p>Rafting through Cataract Canyon is a breathtaking plunge into the heart of Canyonlands National
                        Park, where the Colorado River unleashes some of its most powerful and unpredictable rapids.
                        This stretch features over 25 named rapids, ranging from Class III to Class V during spring
                        runoff, making it one of the most intense whitewater experiences in the West. Rafters navigate
                        towering waves, deep chutes, and dramatic drops surrounded by red rock cliffs, ancient
                        petroglyphs, and vast desert silence. Multi-day trips often include riverside camping,
                        stargazing, and exploration of hidden side canyons, blending high adventure with spiritual
                        solitude.</p>

                    <h3>Grand Canyon</h3>
                    <p>Rafting through the Grand Canyon is a once-in-a-lifetime journey that combines heart-pounding
                        adventure with awe-inspiring natural beauty. As the Colorado River winds through nearly 280
                        miles of layered rock and ancient geology, rafters encounter legendary rapids like Lava Falls
                        and Crystal, ranging from Class III to Class V depending on the season. Multi-day expeditions
                        offer a deep immersion into the canyon’s grandeur, with side hikes to hidden waterfalls, starlit
                        campsites, and moments of spiritual stillness amid towering cliffs. It’s a transformative
                        experience where adrenaline meets reverence, and every bend reveals a new wonder.</p>
